## Usage

### Sentry

`initSentry` function creates an instance of the CMS on Sentry allowing developers and PMs to follow bugs on production environments

See [Exmg Sentry Page](https://play-to-tv.sentry.io/projects/)

Two possible usage, the default one that will report bug on the default project `playtwo-cms`

```ts
initSentry();
```

The configured usage will create a new "project" on Sentry to repot bug for a specific CMS :

```ts
initSentry({
  release: 'custom-cms',
  environment: 'production',
});
```

The Sentry function can be further configured :

```ts
export interface SentryConfig {
  release: string; // Name of the project on Sentry
  environment: string; // Type of the environment
  dsn: string; // Sentry key
  attachStacktrace: boolean; // Wether or not attaching the stack trace to the bug report
}
```
