## Usage

### exmg-lit-cli sass

The Lit Sass CLI allows the developer to generate TS file from SCSS file to be used in Lit Components.
There are two modes to it.

#### Watcher

The default way of working of the Sass CLI is the watcher

```bash
exmg-lit-cli sass
```

The CLI will go through your file tree from the directory it is ran ignoring `node_modules` folder.

#### Providing source files

Alternatively it is possible to run the command by specifying the files to process, that being a single file or a file pattern using the `--files` or `-f` flag

```bash
exmg-lit-cli sass -f \"./src/**/*.scss\"
```

Note that it will process those file and exit, this is not a watcher.
